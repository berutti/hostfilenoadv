Anti Adv hostfile

Use this hostfile in /etc/hosts to remove most advertisements from your web navigation. 
Works for Linux and MacOs.

Warnings: 
- a few sites might not work properly
- your navigation might be impaired or slow if you are using it on an old computer
- DNS resolving will be slower due to the big size of the file!

If you're fine with that give it a try. 
Backup your old hostfile before so you're ready to switch back!
